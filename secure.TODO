# Security TODOs for nsec (private key) handling in AccountScreen

## Potential nsec Leaks
- nsec is held in memory as a String in ViewModel/UI; cannot be zeroed out, may persist until GC.
- If app is backgrounded or process is dumped (rooted device/memory dump), nsec could be extracted.
- nsec is shown in UI after authentication; if user leaves screen with key visible, it could be captured (e.g. screenshot).
- Android allows screenshots by default; consider using FLAG_SECURE to prevent this.
- Never log nsec or objects containing it (including toasts, logs, crash reports).
- If copy-to-clipboard is added, clipboard is accessible by other apps.
- If persisting nsec, always use encrypted storage (EncryptedSharedPreferences, Keystore, etc.).
- Crash reporting tools may capture sensitive fields; ensure nsec is excluded.

## Recommendations
- Add FLAG_SECURE to MainActivity to prevent screenshots/screen recording.
- Hide nsec (set isPrivateKeyVisible = false) when app is backgrounded or screen is left.
- Never log or persist nsec in plaintext.
- Consider using CharArray for extra-sensitive handling (advanced, not typical in UI).
- Only load nsec when needed; clear references when not needed.
- Use secure storage for persistence.
- If copy-to-clipboard is implemented, clear clipboard after timeout.
